== About StaticWebSiteGen ==

StaticWebSiteGen is a project under development and intends to simplify life of people less experienced in creation of a web site and which are supported by an experienced web site developer. A web site developer creates a new site and prepares a page template and the less experienced user can then create, edit, and delete pages. The generator only creates static web pages, so there are no dependencies on a database or a runtime framework.

The page content is written in a simplified Mediawiki-alike markup language and the page template in ERb. Navigation links are created by the generator.
