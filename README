== About StaticWebSiteGen ==

If you are a (possibly lazy) techie and want to build a web site containing just static content for somone non-geeky like your sister, you might get bored by her repeated requests to change "just that line". So you decide that she should change the content herself.

Instead of trying to teach her HTML, CSS, Javascript etc. you can use this tool to create a site and define a template page in ERb. Then your sister can create as many pages as she likes and fill them with content in a simplified mediawiki-like markup language and embed images of her choice.

The output is pure HTML and includes a div tag holding navigation links. There are no dependencies to a database or a framework whatsoever..

== Setup/Update ==
